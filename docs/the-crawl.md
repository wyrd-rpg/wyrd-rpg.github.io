### 1. Define Zones

For each die, add its value to all adjacent dice to determine its main function. Halls and Towers are single zones with all their dice summed.

### 2. Add Details & Secrets
For each zone, roll or choose from the lists.

### 3. Roll Hazard Die

Roll a **Hazard Die** (1d10/2) within a given locale to drive gameplay and introduce complications.

| 1        | 2         | 3         | 4    | 5      |
|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:|:----:|:------:|
| *Setback* | *Depletion* | *Locality* | *Omen* | *Boon* |

To increase tension, the Referee can step up the Hazard Die and roll on the [**Escalating Hazards**](#escalating-hazards) table. Do this after a fight breaks out, an hour of exploration, or any unique event that should raise the stakes.
