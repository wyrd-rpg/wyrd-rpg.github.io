# Combat

## No Initiative

Unless the PCs have been surprised either narratively or through a bad encounter roll, assume PCs have the initiative. *What do you do?*

## Combat Turns

On their turn, a character may move and take one action. This may be casting a spell, making a second move, engaging in combat, attempting a stunt, or any other action deemed reasonable.

## Engage in Combat

To **engage in combat**, PCs test a relevant ability (typically **Power** or **Grace**). Roll your ability die and weapon die, taking the highest result. If the test succeeds, the PC hits their opponent. On a failure, the opponent hits the PC. Narratively, this is a trading of blows, not just a single swing.

## Dealing Damage

Weapon dice results also indicate damage. When damage is dealt, the defender rolls both their **armor die** and **Power**. Armor reduces the damage dealt. If damage surpasses armor, they are wounded. See **[Health, Injury & Death](#health-injury-death)**.

If bearing a shield, they can **sunder** it to reduce any remaining damage to 0.

*Ex: Grog successfully hit the Ud6 Maille-clad Orc with his Ud10 Greatsword. Grog rolls a 4 while the Orc rolls a 5. His blade clangs off metal, the orc is bruised but not hurt. Try again, Grog!*

## Defend Yourself

When it's not your turn, you still best remain alert! There is a fight on. Referees should forewarn of NPC attacks, allowing the PCs to test *their* abilities to avoid a hit. Use **weapon dice** to riposte or counterattack, or **armor dice** to focus on defending.

## Nimble Dodge

If lightly armored, you can add **fatigue** to your sheet to reduce incoming damage, 1 for 1.

## Heavily Clad Dual Wielders

Characters may engage in combat with a weapon in each hand, or wear multiple types of protection, *ex: armor, helmet, and shield.* When dual wielding or heavily clad, roll all weapon or armor dice and use the highest result. On **any** roll of 1, reduce *that piece* of equipment's **[Usage Die](getting-wyrd.md#usage-dice)** by one step.

## Wear & Tear

A common result of **setbacks** (4-5) or **multiple successes** (6++) is to introduce wear and tear on equipment. For a setback, perhaps the PCs weapon connects, but is blunted and stepped down. For a critical success, perhaps the enemy's armor is sundered & stepped down one or more dice. Repairing damaged gear takes materials and time (days or weeks) equal to the current dice value.

## Stunts

Stunts are maneuvers such as shoving, tripping, disarming, sundering armor, and so on. They are resolved with an ability test. They may not cause damage directly, but may do so indirectly *(ex: pushing an enemy off of a ledge).*

## Ranged Weapons

Test a relevant ability to **fire a ranged weapon**. On a failure, the target returns a volley (or other consequence). While engaged in melee, you cannot use ranged weapons. To fire a ranged weapon into a melee at distance, roll with **[hinderance](getting-wyrd.md#help-and-hindrance)**. On a miss, you **hit the wrong target**. Ranged weapons penetrate most armor; defenders roll **all armor dice** at **hinderance**. Black powder weapons require a **turn to reload.**

## Health, Injury & Death :id=health-injury-death

When damage surpasses or ignores armor, characters are **wounded** and must roll their **Power** dice.

- If the result is higher than the remaining damage, the wound is **incidental**.
- If the result is less than or equal to the remaining damage, you suffer a **debilitating wound** and are **incapacitated**.
- On a 1, you suffer a **severe wound** and Power is stepped down. *Ex: Ud6 → Ud4.*
- If a 1 is rolled on a d2 Power, you suffer a **mortal wound** and die.

<!-- - **On a 6+**, the wound is **incidental**.
- **On a 5-6**, suffer a **debilitating wound** and become **incapacitated**.
- **On a 1-3**, suffer a **severe wound** and step down Power. *Ex: Ud6 → Ud4.*
- **If a 1-3 is rolled with d2 Power**, you suffer a **mortal wound** and die. -->

**Incapacitated** characters may return to action once they catch their breath during a safe moment, or when a companion revives them.

**Severe wounds** need time to recover equal to the current dice value in weeks. *ex: 4 weeks rest and recovery to restore d4 to d6.* Enlisting the help of a healer can speed this process.

*Ex: Grog is hit by the Orc's Ud8 Spear. After armor, Grog is dealt 3 damage. He rolls his d6 Power and gets a 1. Gods! He is both incapacitated and suffers a severe wound, reducing Power one step to d4.*
