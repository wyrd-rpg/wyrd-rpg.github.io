# Wyrd

*Wyrd* is *fate* or *destiny*, but not the "inexorable fate" of the ancient Greeks. In Old English, it means, "to come to pass, to become." In Norse, a trinity of goddesses connect all that was, is, and will become. In other words, *Wyrd* is not an end-point, but something continually happening around us at all times.
