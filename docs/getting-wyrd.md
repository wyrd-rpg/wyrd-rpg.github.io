# Getting Wyrd

## Abilities

The four abilities are meant to feel classic yet open to interpretation. Depending on the PC's intent and approach, each ability could arguably be used for any challenge. Make your case.

- **Power** might be used for tests requiring brawn, brute force, or exerting physical presence and authority. Characters have a number of item slots equal to their Power.
- **Grace** might be used for tests using finesse, coordination, reflexes, or social situations involving elegance, refinement or decorum.
- **Intellect** might be used to test mental fortitude while wielding magic, deciphering languages, identifying poisons, or riddling.
- **Will** might be used to test one’s mettle through persuasion, deceit, charm, or to channel (or resist) the otherworldly.

## Rolling the Dice

When attempting something where failure has consequences, **roll an ability die**, starting at d6. XP can raise abilities to d8, d10, or d12. Injury or **[hindrances](#help-and-hindrance)** can decrease them to d4 or d2. **[Help](#help-and-hindrance)** can add additional dice to the roll. If the action requires use of an item with a **[usage dice](#usage-dice)**, roll that as well. The highest die rolled determines the outcome:

| Result | Outcome |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1-3 | **Disaster**. Face the risk’s full consequences. |
| 4-5 | **Setback**. You succeed and suffer a lesser consequence, or achieve partial success. |
| 6+ | **Success**. The higher, the better the result. |
| 6++ | **Multiple Successes**. Gain an added benefit. |

If there are situational factors that make a test easier or harder, the referee should grant **help** or **hindrance**.

## Help and Hindrance

If an action is helped, roll an extra d6 help die. If an ally helps, they roll their ability die, and share the risk. If an action is hindered, step down your ability dice one rank.

## Usage Dice

All consumable items have **usage dice (Ud)**. Weapons, armor, arrows, torches, even abilities, are consumable. When using an item, PCs roll the relevant Ud. For weapons, results also indicate damage. For armor, damage is reduced. A roll of 1 means the item is worn, sundered, or used up, and the usage dice is reduced by 1 step.

##### Ud12 → Ud10 → Ud8 → Ud6 → Ud4 → Ud2

Any Ud can be reduced (by rolling a 1, or other consequence) or increased (by repair, resupply, modification, or magical means). A roll of 1 on a Ud2 **consumes** or **destroys** the item for good.

## Item Slots

PCs have 10 **item slots**. Most items take up 1 slot, but bulky items take up 2. Groups of small, identical items may be bundled into one slot, *ex: a quiver of arrows*. As a general guideline, a slot holds around 5 pounds of weight. Slots can also contain **[fatigue](#fatigue)**.

## Fatigue

PCs deprived of food or rest for more than a day add **fatigue** to their inventory. **[Casting a spell]()**, **[pushing yourself](#pushing-yourself)**, or **[dodging]()** also adds fatigue. Fatigue taken with a full inventory becomes damage, ignoring armor. *[See Health, Injury & Death]()*. After a full night’s rest, roll **Power** to determine the amount of fatigue removed. Remove all fatigue after an extended **downtime** or by **carousing**.

## Pushing Yourself

A character can **push themself** for a **[help die](#rolling-the-dice)** on a single roll by adding one slot of **[fatigue](#fatigue)**.

## NPC Reactions

If it’s unclear how an NPC might react to the party, the referee may **roll 1d6** to find out.

| 1 | 2-3 | 4-5 | 6 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Hostile* | *Wary* | *Friendly* | *Helpful* |

## Morale

Enemies who fail a **Will** test once they take their first casualty or when they lose half their number will try to parley or flee. Lone enemies test morale when they take any wound.

**Hirelings** also make morale rolls when they aren't paid, their employer dies, or they face extraordinary danger. Hirelings who receive better treatment or pay roll with **[help](#help-and-hindrance)**.

## Advancement

Ability scores advance with practice, failure, and reflection. When you **fail** an ability test (1-3) or roll **multiple successes** (6++), mark XP next to your ability. XP can also be earned in downtime by **training** or by **reflecting** on a past failure. If a PC frames a scene around a key instance of **failure**, they earn an additional XP.

When you've earned XP equal to current dice value, step up your ability, (ex: d6 requires 6 XP to become d8).

*Ex: Grog has d6 Power. They must make Power tests until 6 XP is gained through training, failure, reflection, or crits, to increase their Power to d8.*
